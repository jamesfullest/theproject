Collaborator:
Is there a significant difference in Kermit Ranks for pre-talk and post-talk scores(ignoring all other variables)?

Null: no
```{r}
wsr_rank <- wilcox.test(kermit$Score.pre, kermit$Score.post, paired = TRUE)
wsr_rank

#there is no significant difference in Kermit rankings before and after his talk.
